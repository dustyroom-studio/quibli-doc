First of all you need to import Quibli into your project. Please, make sure you have the Universal RP project (not Built-In or HDRP).  
In Unity, go to **Window** ▶︎ **Package Manager**. On the top left, please, find the **Packages** drop down menu. Select **My Assets** item there. You’ll find **Quibli** among your assets. Choose the version you’d like to import. Click **Download** (if it is not downloaded yet), then click **Import**.  

After the importing, to finalize the installation it is advised to configure Quibli for Universal Rendering Pipeline. Please, locate and select the **[Readme] tool** in  
_**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Quibli** folder_  
In the **Inspector** panel press the **Configure for URP** button. This will set the example _Quibli Rendering Pipeline Asset_ into **Graphics** and **Quality** windows found in **Project Settings**.
