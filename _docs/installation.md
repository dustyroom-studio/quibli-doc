## Importing Quibli
First of all, you need to import Quibli into your project.  

Please, make sure you have the Universal RP project running (not Built-In RP or HDRP).    
{: .notice--warning}

* In Unity, go to **Window** ▶︎ **Package Manager**; 
* On the top left, please, find the **Packages** drop down menu. Select **My Assets** item there. You’ll find **Quibli** among your assets. Choose the version you’d like to import;  
* Click **Download** (if it is not downloaded yet);  
* Click **Import**.  

## Finalizing Quibli Installation
After the importing, to finalize the installation it is advised to configure Quibli for Universal Rendering Pipeline. 
* Please, locate and select the **[Readme] tool** in  
_**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Quibli** folder_  
* In the **Inspector** panel press the **Configure for URP** button. This will set the example _Quibli Rendering Pipeline Asset_ into **Graphics** and **Quality** windows found in **Project Settings**.
