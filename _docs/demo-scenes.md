excerpt: "Demo Scenes Included in Quibli"

In the scenes we tried to showcase a variety of use cases for the Quibli shaders: [Stylized Lit](../stylized-lit-shader), [Foliage](../foliage-shader), [Grass](../grass-shader), [Skybox](../skybox-shader), [Cloud2D](../cloud2d-shader), [Light Beam]([../light-beam-shader) as well as the post effects and additional tools.  

The scenes can be found in:  
_**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Quibli** folder ▶︎ **Demo Scenes** folder

*Path to the Demo Scenes included in Quibli*

#### Nature Scene  
A detailed scene showing all the shaders in action. The foliage has been created using the _Foliage Generator_ plugin. On this scene the shading of the plants has been made using _Stylized Lit_ shader, unlike _Foliage_ shader, which is more specialized for nature objects like trees and bushes. This one in action can be seen on the included [Sample Scene with Quibli](#sample-scene-with-quibli) scene.  

#### City Scene  
Another detailed scene showing all the shaders and additional tools in action.  

#### Kitchenware Scene
This is a family of mostly saturated brightly colored scenes designed to show more unusual use of the _Stylized Lit_ shader. Aside from the anime shading, it is possible to conveniently generate something unrelated, be it the basic coloring or something wild and unique. There is nothing unconventional going on, it is just the choice of the colors and the parameters that made up these scenes, particularly the Gradient editor settings on _Stylized Lit_ and _Skybox_ shaders.

*Kitchenware Demo Scene 2 — smooth-mode Color Gradient ramp with color stops set tightly and loosely, with vibrant colors. The Skybox is made with the _Skybox_ shader, using a single color ramp, also with tight and loose color stops*

#### Mugs Scene  
As in [Flat Kit](https://flatkit.dustyroom.com/#6-demo-scenes){:target="_blank"}, we added the same demo scene contents to be used with _Stylized Lit_ shader materials. This scene is made to show a fraction of styles that can be achieved — at a glance. ‘A fraction’ is because these examples are only a few of the possible unique and unseen results due to the power of parameter combinations.  

#### Sample Scene with Quibli  
This is a modified start-up Unity scene, which you can see when you open a new project in Unity. We kept the original colors and textures, but changed all materials from the standard Unity Lit shader to the _Stylized Lit_ shader, and _Skybox_, as well as added the clouds using the _Cloud2D_ shader and a few foliage and decoration models. The character is also a standard Unity textured model called _Ellen_.  

#### Clouds Scene  
A showcase of a few examples of the _Cloud2D_ shader. The way the shader works can be utilized in a wide variety of creative use cases. As you can see, with _Cloud 2D_ shader, it is possible to do more than clouds: fire, smoke, even some more unusual effects like northern lights. Press Play to start the animation of the clouds.
