#### **Q.** What is the difference between Quibli and Flat Kit?
> **A.** Please, look at [this chapter](../quibli-or-flat-kit), which compares the two.

#### **Q.** After installing Quibli outputs errors.
> **A.** Please, look into the [Troubleshooting](../installation#troubleshooting) sub-chapter in the [Quick Start Guide](../installation) chapter.

#### **Q.** The scenes look different from the screenshots.
> **A.** The screenshots on the Asset Store are taken from the scenes, without any processing or color correction whatsoever, i.e. they should look virtually the same as the scenes, minus the embedded promotional text. The differences may occur if your project is in **_Gamma color space_**, as the scenes were made in **_Linear color space_**. Another reason may be in the **unfinished setup** ([how to finalize Quibli setup?](../installation/#finalizing-quibli-installation)), when the scene can't find the needed forward renderer.

#### **Q.** What Rendering Pipelines does Quibli support?
> **A.** Quibli supports Universal (URP, fka LWRP) only. It won't work in Built-In RP and HDRP.
